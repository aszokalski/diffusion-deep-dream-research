## Exploration
This directory contains exploratory code that was used to understand the domain, perform sanity checks and initially validate / fine-tune the method. Like a scratchpad.

The code in this directory is low quality and poorly organised - it is provided for transparency purposes only. 

Gemini 3 was used to quickly prototype some scripts in this folder.

This directory is also excluded in Ty / Ruff configuration because the type checking is not enforced.
