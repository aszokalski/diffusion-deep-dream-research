## Exploration
This directory contains exploratory code that was used to understand the domain, perform sanity checks and initially validate / fine-tune the method. Like a scratchpad.

The code in this directory is low quality and poorly organised - it is provided for transparency purposes only. 

Gemini 3 was used to quickly prototype some scripts in this folder.

This directory is also excluded in Ty / Ruff configuration because the type checking is not enforced.

IMPORTANT NOTE: This code is NOT a part of the framework implementation. It's only a notepad and shouldn't be treated as a part of this thesis. It's a background for some of the ideas that made it to the final version.
